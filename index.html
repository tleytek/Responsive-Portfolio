        <p class="loremtest">Hello, and welcome to my website! My name is Mateus Koehler, I am currently working as a truck driver while attending
            a Coding Bootcamp at UTM (University of Toronto Mississauga) by Trilogy Education Services. I have a college
            diploma in Electronics Engineering, so I really like tinkering and opening electronics to see whats inside. In
            highschool, my progamming classes had been my most enjoyable, and looking back I can't figure out why I didn't
            pursue further education in it. So here I am now, taking the coding bootcamp to change careers!
        </p>
        <p class="loremtest">When I got to looking at coding as a career, I couldn't help but feel frustrated at the lack of mainstream innovation
            in a progammers main tool, the keyboard! I found the default QWERTY keyboards to be inefficient and counter-intuitive.
            The layout is horizontally staggered which was a design choice made due to way type-writers functioned. Our keyboards
            don't have the limitations type-writers had, so why are we still using it? There are many improvements
            that I see could be done to the keyboard, but the main take away is that form should follow function, not the
            other way around.</p>

        <p class="loremtest">If you have any questions you would like to ask me please don't hesitate to contact me.</p>
